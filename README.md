# Maze Solver

This program solves a maze represented by a graph where arrows indicate movements. It uses a modified depth-first search algorithm to find a path from the starting position to the target position.

## Usage

1. **Input:**
   - The maze is defined in the `input.txt` file.
   - Each line in the file represents a row in the maze, and arrows are separated by spaces.

2. **Compile:**
   ```bash
   make

```

1. **Run:**
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    ./maze
    
    ```
    
2. **Output:**
    - The program outputs the sequence of moves required to solve the maze.

## **Input Format**

The input file (**`input.txt`**) should contain the maze graph in the following format:

```css
cssCopy code
R-S R-S R-SE
B-NE B-NW R-S
B-NE B-E O

```

Here, R represents a red arrow, B represents a blue arrow, and O represents the target position.

## **Output Format**

The output displays the sequence of moves needed to solve the maze:

```mathematica
mathematicaCopy code
1S 1NE 2S 1E

```

## **Makefile Commands**

- **`make`**: Compile the program.
- **`make clean`**: Remove compiled files.

## **Dependencies**

- C++ compiler (supporting C++14)
